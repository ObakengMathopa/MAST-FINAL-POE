# MAST-FINAL-POE
I've made improvements with the user interface as the previous user interface had a couple of errors in it and was not as user friendly.
I've the images used in the previous user interfeace as the previous imges were not as appealing.
i've made changes in the second page of the final POE user interface as the previous user interface was not up to standard.
Finally, i've given changed the user interface and how it looks as during the process of programming the codes for the previous user interface had errors that were difficult to fix.
